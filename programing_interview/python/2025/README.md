- Idea of this directory to keep solving and learning coding chanlleges and, to keep contributing my solutions to this directory. 
- Initial idea was to create a directory structure in such a way that it can be divided into series of algorithms. However, keeping it in the timeseries order will help me track my daily progress. And, contribute the solutions to
the git repo. 
- Keeping tabs on myself to stick the coding problems so that it can be utilized with my daily work schedule
